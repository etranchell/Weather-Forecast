# Weather Forecast

## Description

My motivation to build this project was to help keep people informed of current weather as well as the forecast for any city they search for.
I built this project so people can prepare for their day and week by knowing the correct weather.
The problem it solves is hopefully no more getting caught in a rain storm.  It will also help people dress properly for all weather.
I learned about server side APIs.
